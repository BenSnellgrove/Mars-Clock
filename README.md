# Mars clock

A simple clock for the current adjusted time on Mars\
Created back in April of 2021 for no particular reason

The `.pyw` ending runs the script without a python terminal for convenience

All of the maths is copied from [this website](http://marsclock.com/)\
This is just a python implementation
